**Lab: Creating a Simple Chatbot in Python**

**Objective:** By the end of this lab, you will be able to create a simple chatbot in Python using the ChatterBot library.

**Tools Required:**
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Text editor or Python IDE (like PyCharm, Jupyter notebook, or VS Code)

**Steps:**

1. **Setup your Python Environment**
   - Make sure Python and pip are installed on your system. You can verify this by typing `python --version` and `pip --version` in your terminal/command prompt.

2. **Install ChatterBot Library**
   - ChatterBot is a Python library that makes it easy to generate automated responses to a userâ€™s input. Install it using pip:
     ```
     pip install chatterbot
     ```

3. **Create a New Python File**
   - Open your text editor or Python IDE and create a new Python file. You can name it `chatbot.py`.

4. **Import Required Libraries**
   - At the top of your Python file, import the necessary libraries:
     ```python
     from chatterbot import ChatBot
     from chatterbot.trainers import ChatterBotCorpusTrainer
     ```

5. **Create a ChatBot Instance**
   - Now, create an instance of ChatBot and give it a name. Here, we'll name our chatbot 'Bot':
     ```python
     chatbot = ChatBot('Bot')
     ```

6. **Train the ChatBot**
   - Next, we'll train our chatbot using the ChatterBotCorpusTrainer. This trainer allows the chatbot to learn responses to common phrases from the ChatterBot corpus data:
     ```python
     trainer = ChatterBotCorpusTrainer(chatbot)
     trainer.train("chatterbot.corpus.english")
     ```

7. **Create a Chat Interface**
   - Now, let's create a simple chat interface where the user can interact with the chatbot. We'll use a while loop to keep the chat going until the user types 'quit':
     ```python
     print('Hello, I am Bot. How can I assist you? If you want to exit, type quit.')
     while True:
         user_input = input("User: ")
         if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
             break
         response = chatbot.get_response(user_input)
         print("Bot: ", response)
     ```

8. **Run the Chatbot**
   - Save your Python file and run it in the terminal/command prompt using the command `python chatbot.py`. You should now be able to chat with your bot!

**Note:** This is a very basic chatbot and its performance can be improved by using more advanced techniques like incorporating machine learning algorithms, using a more sophisticated training dataset, or integrating with AI services like Google's Dialogflow or Microsoft's Bot Framework.

- Twilio account

**Steps:**

1. **Setup your Python Environment**
   - Make sure Python and pip are installed on your system. You can verify this by typing `python --version` and `pip --version` in your terminal/command prompt.

2. **Install Required Libraries**
   - Install the necessary libraries using pip:
     ```
     pip install chatterbot flask twilio
     ```

3. **Create a New Python File**
   - Open your text editor or Python IDE and create a new Python file. You can name it `chatbot_service.py`.

4. **Import Required Libraries**
   - At the top of your Python file, import the necessary libraries:
     ```python
     from flask import Flask, request
     from twilio.twiml.messaging_response import MessagingResponse
     from chatterbot import ChatBot
     from chatterbot.trainers import ChatterBotCorpusTrainer
     ```

5. **Create and Train a ChatBot Instance**
   - This step is similar to the previous lab. Create an instance of ChatBot and train it:
     ```python
     chatbot = ChatBot('Bot')
     trainer = ChatterBotCorpusTrainer(chatbot)
     trainer.train("chatterbot.corpus.english")
     ```

6. **Create a Flask App**
   - Now, let's create a Flask app and define a route that will handle incoming messages:
     ```python
     app = Flask(__name__)

     @app.route("/sms", methods=['POST'])
     def sms_reply():
         # Get the message the user sent our Twilio number
         user_message = request.values.get('Body', None)

         # Get a response from the chatbot
         response = str(chatbot.get_response(user_message))

         # Create a Twilio response object to be able to send a reply back (as an SMS)
         twilio_response = MessagingResponse()
         twilio_response.message(response)

         return str(twilio_response)

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         app.run(debug=True)
     ```

7. **Setup Twilio Webhook**
   - Log in to your Twilio account, go to the console, and select your active phone number. Under the messaging section, find the "A Message Comes In" field and set the webhook to the URL of your Flask app (e.g., `http://your-server.com/sms`). Make sure the HTTP method is set to POST.

8. **Run the Chatbot Service**
   - Save your Python file and run it in the terminal/command prompt using the command `python chatbot_service.py`. You should now be able to interact with your chatbot through SMS!

**Note:** This lab assumes that you have a publicly accessible server where your Flask app is running. If you're working locally, you can use tools like ngrok to expose your local server to the internet.

             return True

         def process(self, statement, additional_response_selection_parameters):
             sentiment = self.sia.polarity_scores(statement.text)
             confidence = abs(sentiment['compound'])
             if sentiment['compound'] > 0:
                 response_statement = Statement(text="I'm glad you're feeling good!")
             else:

     ```python
     chatbot = ChatBot('Bot', logic_adapters=['chatterbot.logic.BestMatch', 'chatbot_nlp.SentimentAdapter'])
     trainer = ChatterBotCorpusTrainer(chatbot)
     trainer.train("chatterbot.corpus.english")
     ```

7. **Create a Flask App with Logging**
   - Now, let's create a Flask app and define a route that will handle incoming messages. We'll also add logging statements to track incoming messages and the chatbot's responses:

         logging.info(f"Received user message: {user_message}")

         # Get a response from the chatbot
         response = str(chatbot.get_response(user_message))
         logging.info(f"Chatbot response

: {response}")

         # Create a Twilio response object to be able to send a reply back (as an SMS)
         twilio_response = MessagingResponse()
         twilio_response.message(response)

         return str(twilio_response)

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         app.run(debug=True)
     ```

8. **Run the Chatbot Service**

     ```
     pip install nltk
     ```

3. **Download NLTK Data**
   - You will need some datasets from NLTK for stopword removal and lemmatization. You can download these datasets using the following commands in Python:
     ```python
     import nltk
     nltk.download('stopwords')
     nltk.download('wordnet')
     ```

4. **Create a New Python File**
   - Open your text editor or Python IDE and create a new Python file. You can name it `data_preprocessing_part1.py`.

     import string
     import nltk
     from nltk.corpus import stopwords
     from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
     ```

6. **Define Text Cleaning and Normalization Functions**
   - Now, let's define some functions for text cleaning and normalization. We'll create functions for lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, and lemmatization:
     ```python
     def lowercase_text(text):
         return text.lower()

     def remove_punctuation(text):
         return text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))

     def remove_stopwords(text):
         stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
         words = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
         words = [word for word in words if word not in stop_words]
         return ' '.join(words)

     def lemmatize_text(text):
         lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
         words = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
         words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in words]
         return ' '.join(words)
     ```

7. **Test the Functions**
   - Finally, let's test our functions with a sample sentence:
     ```python
     text = "This is a sample sentence, showing off the stop words filtration."

     text = lowercase_text(text)
     print(text)  # Output: "this is a sample sentence, showing off the stop words filtration."

     text = remove_punctuation(text)
     print(text)  # Output: "this is a sample sentence showing off the stop words filtration"

     text = remove_stopwords(text)
     print(text)  # Output: "sample sentence showing stop words filtration"

     text = lemmatize_text(text)
     print(text)  # Output: "sample sentence show stop word filtration"
     ```

**Note:** This is the first part of the data preprocessing lab. In the next parts, we will cover tokenization, sequence padding, and splitting the data into training and validation sets.

   - Install the necessary libraries using pip:
     ```
     pip install keras
     ```

3. **Create a New Python File**
   - Open your text editor or Python IDE and create a new Python file. You can name it `data_preprocessing_part2.py`.

4. **Import Required Libraries**
   - At the top of your Python file, import the necessary libraries:
     ```python
     from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
     from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
     ```

5. **Define Tokenization and Padding Functions**
   - Now, let's define some functions for tokenization and sequence padding. We'll create a function to tokenize text and convert it to sequences of integers, and another function to pad these sequences to the same length:
     ```python
     def tokenize_text(texts, num_words):
         tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=num_words)
         tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)
         sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(texts)
         return sequences, tokenizer

     def pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen):
         return pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=maxlen)
     ```

6. **Test the Functions**
   - Finally, let's test our functions with some sample sentences:
     ```python
     texts = ["This is the first sentence.", "And this is another one.", "Can we try a third sentence?"]

     sequences, tokenizer = tokenize_text(texts, num_words=100)
     print(sequences)  # Output: [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 1, 2, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12, 4, 5]]

     padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=10)
     print(padded_sequences)  # Output: [[0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 4 5], [0 0 0 0 0 6 1 2 7 8], [0 0 0 0 9 10 11 12 4 5]]
     ```

**Note:** This is the second part of the data preprocessing lab. In the next part, we will cover splitting the data into training and validation sets.

**Lab: Data Preprocessing for Chatbots - Part 3: Splitting the Data into Training and Validation Sets**

**Objective:** By the end of this lab, you will be able to split your preprocessed data into training and validation sets. This is an essential step in preparing your data for a chatbot, as it allows you to evaluate the performance of your model on unseen data.

**Tools Required:**
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Text editor or Python IDE (like PyCharm, Jupyter notebook, or VS Code)
- scikit-learn

**Steps:**

1. **Setup your Python Environment**
   - Make sure Python and pip are installed on your system. You can verify this by typing `python --version` and `pip --version` in your terminal/command prompt.

2. **Install Required Libraries**
   - Install the necessary libraries using pip:
     ```
     pip install scikit-learn
     ```

3. **Create a New Python File**
   - Open your text editor or Python IDE and create a new Python file. You can name it `data_preprocessing_part3.py`.

4. **Import Required Libraries**
   - At the top of your Python file, import the necessary libraries:
     ```python
     from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
     ```

5. **Define a Function to Split the Data**
   - Now, let's define a function to split the data into training and validation sets. We'll use the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn, which shuffles the data and splits it into two sets:
     ```python
     def split_data(inputs, targets, test_size=0.2, random_state=42):
         inputs_train, inputs_val, targets_train, targets_val = train_test_split(inputs, targets, test_size=test_size, random_state=random_state)
         return inputs_train, inputs_val, targets_train, targets_val
     ```

6. **Test the Function**
   - Finally, let's test our function with some sample data. We'll assume that `sequences` is a list of integer sequences representing the input data, and `targets` is a list of integer sequences representing the target data:
     ```python
     sequences = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]
     targets = [[2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13]]

     inputs_train, inputs_val, targets_train, targets_val = split_data(sequences, targets)
     print(inputs_train)  # Output: [[4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [1, 2, 3]]
     print(inputs_val)  # Output: [[7, 8, 9]]
     print(targets_train)  # Output: [[5, 6, 7], [11, 12, 13], [2, 3, 4]]
     print(targets_val)  # Output: [[8, 9, 10]]
     ```

**Note:** This is the final part of the data preprocessing lab. You now have a set of functions to clean and normalize text, convert text to sequences, pad sequences, and split the data into training and validation sets.

**Lab: Building a Chatbot with Rasa - Part 1: Data Sanitization**

**Objective:** By the end of this lab, you will be able to sanitize and prepare your data for training a chatbot using Rasa. This includes techniques such as data cleaning, intent and entity annotation, and creating conversation stories.

**Tools Required:**
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Text editor or Python IDE (like PyCharm, Jupyter notebook, or VS Code)
- Rasa

**Steps:**

1. **Setup your Python Environment**
   - Make sure Python and pip are installed on your system. You can verify this by typing `python --version` and `pip --version` in your terminal/command prompt.

2. **Install Required Libraries**
   - Install Rasa using pip:
     ```
     pip install rasa
     ```

3. **Create a New Rasa Project**
   - Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Rasa project. Then, create a new Rasa project using the command:
     ```
     rasa init --no-prompt
     ```
   - This will create a new Rasa project with some example files that we'll modify in the next steps.

4. **Sanitize Your Data**
   - For this lab, we'll assume you have a dataset of user messages and their corresponding intents and entities. The first step is to sanitize this data by removing any irrelevant information, correcting typos, and standardizing the format.

5. **Annotate Intents and Entities**
   - Open the `nlu.yml` file in the `data` directory of your Rasa project. This is where you'll define the intents and entities for your chatbot.
   - For each unique intent in your data, add an entry under `intents:`. Then, for each user message corresponding to that intent, add an example under `nlu:`. If the message includes entities, annotate them in the format `[entity_value](entity_name)`. Here's an example:
     ```yaml
     version: "2.0"

     nlu:
     - intent: greet
       examples: |
         - Hi
         - Hello
         - Hey
     - intent: book_flight
       examples: |
         - I want to book a flight to [New York](location)
         - Can you help me book a flight to [Paris](location)?
     ```

6. **Create Conversation Stories**
   - Open the `stories.yml` file in the `data` directory of your Rasa project. This is where you'll define the conversation stories for your chatbot.
   - For each possible conversation flow in your data, add a story under `stories:`. A story consists of a sequence of user messages (intents and entities) and chatbot actions. Here's an example:
     ```yaml
     version: "2.0"

     stories:
     - story: book flight story
       steps:
       - intent: greet
       - action: utter_greet
       - intent: book_flight
         entities:
         - location: "New York"
       - action: utter_book_flight
     ```

**Note:** This is the first part of the Rasa chatbot lab. In the next parts, we will cover training a model and implementing the model.

Happy coding!

1. **Focus:** Each part can focus on a specific aspect of the process (data sanitization, model training, and model implementation), allowing for a more in-depth exploration of each step.

2. **Manageability:** Smaller, more manageable parts can be less overwhelming, especially for beginners. It also allows for natural break points where learners can pause, reflect, and consolidate their learning.

3. **Flexibility:** If the lab is part of a course or curriculum, breaking it up can provide more flexibility in how the material is presented and scheduled.

Given the complexity of building a chatbot with Rasa, which involves several distinct steps each with its own set of concepts and techniques, breaking the lab into three parts would likely be beneficial. However, the decision ultimately depends on the specific context and audience.

**Lab: Building a Chatbot with Rasa - Part 2: Training the Model**

**Objective:** By the end of this lab, you will be able to train a chatbot model using Rasa. This includes defining the pipeline, training the NLU model, and training the dialogue management model.

**Tools Required:**
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Text editor or Python IDE (like PyCharm, Jupyter notebook, or VS Code)
- Rasa

**Steps:**

1. **Setup your Python Environment**
   - Make sure Python and pip are installed on your system. You can verify this by typing `python --version` and `pip --version` in your terminal/command prompt.

2. **Define the Pipeline**
   - Open the `config.yml` file in the root directory of your Rasa project. This is where you'll define the pipeline for your chatbot.
   - The pipeline specifies the sequence of processing steps that Rasa will use to train the NLU model. The choice of pipeline depends on your data and use case, but a common choice is the `supervised_embeddings` pipeline. Here's an example:
     ```yaml
     language: en
     pipeline: supervised_embeddings
     ```

3. **Train the NLU Model**
   - Now, let's train the NLU model. Open your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the root directory of your Rasa project, and run the following command:
     ```
     rasa train nlu
     ```
   - This will train the NLU model using the data in `nlu.yml` and the pipeline in `config.yml`. The trained model will be saved in the `models` directory.

4. **Define the Dialogue Management Model**
   - Open the `domain.yml` file in the root directory of your Rasa project. This is where you'll define the dialogue management model for your chatbot.
   - The dialogue management model specifies the intents, entities, slots, and actions that your chatbot can handle, as well as the templates for the chatbot's responses. Here's an example:
     ```yaml
     intents:
     - greet
     - book_flight

     entities:
     - location

     slots:
       location:
         type: text

     responses:
       utter_greet:
       - text: "Hello! How can I help you today?"

       utter_book_flight:
       - text: "Sure, I can help you book a flight. Where would you like to go?"

     actions:
     - utter_greet
     - utter_book_flight
     ```

5. **Train the Dialogue Management Model**
   - Finally, let's train the dialogue management model. Run the following command in your terminal/command prompt:
     ```
     rasa train core
     ```
   - This will train the dialogue management model using the data in `stories.yml` and the domain in `domain.yml`. The trained model will be saved in the `models` directory.

**Note:** This is the second part of the Rasa chatbot lab. In the next part, we will cover implementing the model.

**Lab: Building a Chatbot with Rasa - Part 3: Implementing the Model**

**Objective:** By the end of this lab, you will be able to implement a chatbot model using Rasa. This includes loading the trained model, interacting with the chatbot in the command line, and evaluating the model's performance.

**Tools Required:**
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Text editor or Python IDE (like PyCharm, Jupyter notebook, or VS Code)
- Rasa

**Steps:**

1. **Setup your Python Environment**
   - Make sure Python and pip are installed on your system. You can verify this by typing `python --version` and `pip --version` in your terminal/command prompt.

2. **Load the Trained Model**
   - After training the NLU and dialogue management models in the previous parts of the lab, you should have a `.tar.gz` file in the `models` directory of your Rasa project. This file contains the trained model.
   - To load the trained model, you don't need to do anything special. Rasa will automatically use the latest model in the `models` directory.

3. **Interact with the Chatbot in the Command Line**
   - Now, let's interact with the chatbot. Open your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the root directory of your Rasa project, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    rasa shell
    ```

   - This will start a conversation with the chatbot in the command line. You can type your messages, and the chatbot will respond based on the trained model.

4. **Evaluate the Model's Performance**
   - Finally, let's evaluate the performance of the model. Rasa provides several commands to evaluate the NLU and dialogue management models.
   - To evaluate the NLU model, run the following command in your terminal/command prompt:

    ```bash
    rasa test nlu --nlu data/nlu.yml
    ```

   - This will evaluate the NLU model using the data in `nlu.yml` and print the evaluation results.
   - To evaluate the dialogue management model, run the following command:

    ```bash
    rasa test core --stories data/stories.yml
    ```

   - This will evaluate the dialogue management model using the data in `stories.yml` and print the evaluation results.

**Note:** This is the final part of the Rasa chatbot lab. You now have a functioning chatbot that you can interact with in the command line and evaluate its performance.
