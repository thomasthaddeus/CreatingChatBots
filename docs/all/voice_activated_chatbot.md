   pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 rasa
   ```

2. **Listening to the Microphone**
   ```python
   import speech_recognition as sr

   recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
   with sr.Microphone() as source:
       print("Listening...")
       audio = recognizer.listen(source)
       text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
       print("You said:", text)
   ```

**Part 2: Setting Up Text-to-Speech**

1. **Converting Text to Speech**
   ```python
   import pyttsx3

   engine = pyttsx3.init()
   engine.say("Hello, how can I help you?")
   engine.runAndWait()
   ```

**Part 3: Integrating with a Chatbot**

1. **Setting Up a Basic Rasa Chatbot**
   - For this step, you can refer to previous labs on setting up a Rasa chatbot.

**Lab: Building a Voice-Activated Chatbot - Expanded Part 1: Setting Up Speech Recognition**

**Objective:** Understand the intricacies of setting up speech recognition for your chatbot, including handling ambient noise and different accents.

**Tools Required:**
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Text editor or Python IDE (like PyCharm, Jupyter notebook, or VS Code)
- Libraries: SpeechRecognition

**1. Installing the SpeechRecognition Library**

   The `SpeechRecognition` library is the main tool we'll use for converting spoken language into text.
   ```bash
   pip install SpeechRecognition
   ```

**2. Basics of the SpeechRecognition Library**

   - **Recognizer Class:** This is the primary class that you'll interact with. It contains various methods to recognize speech from an audio source.

   - **Microphone Class:** Represents a physical microphone and allows you to capture input from it.

**3. Listening to the Microphone and Recognizing Speech**

   ```python
   import speech_recognition as sr

   recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
   ```

   - **Adjusting for Ambient Noise:** Before listening to the user, it's a good idea to calibrate the recognizer to the noise level of the environment.
     ```python
     with sr.Microphone() as source:
         recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source, duration=5)
         print("Calibrated to ambient noise. Now listening...")
     ```

   - **Capturing Audio from the Microphone:**
     ```python
     with sr.Microphone() as source:
         print("Listening...")
         audio = recognizer.listen(source)
     ```

   - **Converting Audio to Text:** The library supports various recognition services, but for this example, we'll use Google's web-based speech recognition.
     ```python
     try:
         text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
         print("You said:", text)
     except sr.UnknownValueError:
         print("Sorry, I did not catch that.")
     except sr.RequestError:
         print("API unavailable.")
     ```

**4. Handling Different Accents and Languages**

   The `recognize_google` function has a `language` parameter that allows you to specify the language of the spoken text. This can be useful if you're building a chatbot for users who speak different languages or have different accents.

   ```python
   # For French
   text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio, language='fr-FR')

   # For Spanish
   text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio, language='es-ES')
   ```

**5. Error Handling**

   As seen in the basic example, it's essential to handle exceptions that might occur during speech recognition. This ensures that your chatbot can handle situations where it doesn't understand the user or when there's an issue with the recognition service.

**Lab: Building a Voice-Activated Chatbot - Expanded Part 2: Setting Up Text-to-Speech**

**Objective:** Understand the intricacies of setting up text-to-speech for your chatbot, including voice customization, speech rate, and volume control.

**Tools Required:**
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Text editor or Python IDE (like PyCharm, Jupyter notebook, or VS Code)
- Libraries: pyttsx3

**1. Installing the pyttsx3 Library**

   `pyttsx3` is a text-to-speech conversion library that works offline and is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.
   ```bash
   pip install pyttsx3
   ```

**2. Basics of the pyttsx3 Library**

   - **Initialization:** Before you can use the library, you need to initialize it. This will start the text-to-speech engine.
     ```python
     import pyttsx3
     engine = pyttsx3.init()
     ```

**3. Converting Text to Speech**

   The primary function to convert text to speech is `say()`, and to actually produce the speech, you use `runAndWait()`.
   ```python
   engine.say("Hello, how can I help you?")
   engine.runAndWait()
   ```

**4. Customizing Voice Properties**

   - **Changing Voice:** The library typically has access to multiple voices on your system. You can switch between them.
     ```python
     voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
     # Use the second voice (this might be a different gender or accent)
     engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)
     ```

   - **Adjusting Rate of Speech:** You can speed up or slow down the speech rate.
     ```python
     rate = engine.getProperty('rate')
     engine.setProperty('rate', rate-50)  # Decrease rate by 50
     ```

   - **Adjusting Volume:** You can also adjust the volume of the speech, with 1.0 being the maximum volume.
     ```python
     volume = engine.getProperty('volume')
     engine.setProperty('volume', volume-0.1)  # Decrease volume by 0.1
     ```

**5. Saving Speech to a File**

   Instead of directly speaking out the text, you can save it as an audio file. This can be useful for debugging or for generating audio clips.
   ```python
   engine.save_to_file("Hello, how can I help you?", 'output.mp3')
   engine.runAndWait()
   ```

**6. Error Handling and Cleanup**

   It's always a good practice to handle potential errors and ensure resources are cleaned up after use.
   ```python
   try:
       engine.say("Hello, how can I help you?")
       engine.runAndWait()
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
   finally:
       engine.stop()
   ```

**Lab: Building a Voice-Activated Chatbot - Expanded Part 3: Integrating with a Chatbot**

**Objective:** Understand the intricacies of integrating voice functionalities with a chatbot, including processing voice commands, generating dynamic responses, and ensuring smooth user interactions.

**Tools Required:**
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Text editor or Python IDE (like PyCharm, Jupyter notebook, or VS Code)
- Libraries: Rasa, SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3

**1. Setting Up a Basic Rasa Chatbot**

   Before integrating voice functionalities, ensure you have a basic Rasa chatbot set up. This chatbot will process the text converted from voice input and generate appropriate text responses.

   - **Installation and Initialization:**
     ```bash
     pip install rasa
     rasa init
     ```

   - **Training the Chatbot:**
     ```bash
     rasa train
     ```

**2. Integrating Voice Input with the Chatbot**

   - **Capture Voice Input:**
     Use the `SpeechRecognition` library to capture voice input from the user and convert it into text.
     ```python
     import speech_recognition as sr
     recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

     with sr.Microphone() as source:
         print("Listening...")
         audio = recognizer.listen(source)
         user_message = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
     ```

   - **Process Voice Input with Rasa:**
     Pass the converted text to the Rasa chatbot for processing.
     ```python
     from rasa.core.agent import Agent
     from rasa.core.interpreter import RasaNLUInterpreter

     interpreter = RasaNLUInterpreter('./models/nlu')
     agent = Agent.load('./models', interpreter=interpreter)

     responses = await agent.handle_text(user_message)
     chatbot_response = responses[0]['text']
     ```

**3. Integrating Voice Output with the Chatbot**

   - **Convert Chatbot's Text Response to Voice:**
     Use the `pyttsx3` library to convert the chatbot's text response into voice and provide a verbal response to the user.
     ```python
     import pyttsx3
     engine = pyttsx3.init()

     engine.say(chatbot_response)
     engine.runAndWait()
     ```

**4. Continuous Interaction Loop**

   To allow continuous interaction with the chatbot, set up a loop where the chatbot listens for voice commands, processes them, and responds verbally.
   ```python
   while True:
       with sr.Microphone() as source:
           print("Listening...")
           audio = recognizer.listen(source)
           user_message = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)

       responses = await agent.handle_text(user_message)
       chatbot_response = responses[0]['text']

       engine.say(chatbot_response)
       engine.runAndWait()
   ```

**5. Enhancing User Experience**

   - **Handling Unrecognized Speech:**
     If the chatbot fails to recognize the user's speech, provide a default response to guide the user.
     ```python
     try:
         user_message = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
     except sr.UnknownValueError:
         engine.say("Sorry, I didn't catch that. Can you please repeat?")
         engine.runAndWait()
         continue
     ```

   - **Exit Command:**
     Allow users to exit the interaction loop with a specific voice command, such as "goodbye" or "exit".
     ```python
     if user_message.lower() in ["goodbye", "exit"]:
         engine.say("Goodbye!")
         engine.runAndWait()
         break
     ```
